📊 Blinkit Sales Data Analysis – Python

This Python-based data analysis project provides a detailed analysis of Blinkit sales performance using structured sales data.
The project focuses on uncovering sales trends, outlet performance, product behavior, and customer-related patterns through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.

It helps transform raw sales data into meaningful insights that support business understanding and decision-making.

🧩 Business Problem Solved

Blinkit operates across multiple outlets with various product categories, outlet sizes, and customer preferences.
However, understanding which factors drive sales performance was challenging due to the presence of raw and unstructured data.

Business stakeholders lacked clear answers to questions such as:

Which outlet types and sizes generate the highest sales?

How does fat content impact total sales?

Which item categories contribute the most revenue?

How is sales performance distributed across different outlets?

What patterns exist in overall sales behavior?

Due to this, insights were hidden within data, slowing down data-driven decisions.
